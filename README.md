### Project Title
Post your Work on GitHub

### Description
The whole idea of this project is to put into practice what we have learned about version control and GitHub.
The purpose of this project is described below:-

#### Project Overview
This project aims to simulate a realistic workflow to refactor the previous BikeShare project using Git. Here's an overview for this project tasks.

###### Repository Setup
First, the task is to fork a repository to get a copy of a template for this project, and then clone it to the local computer. Next, the task is to add bikeshare.py file, data file, and a .gitignore file to exclude data file from version control tracking to avoid sharing data publicly, tracking unnecessarily huge files on GitHub, and most importantly changes in data don't often affect the code.

###### Documentation
After that, create branches using Git to make some changes to the project. In the real world, it's common to use different branches to manage the development of separate features or changes to a project.

###### Refactor Code
The next branch requires to complete this project is refactoring. Here, bikeshare.py file is modified to make improvements to the efficiency or readability of the code. The goal is to practice committing code with at least three commits on this branch with meaningful messages.

##### Merge Branches
Finally, merge both branches to the master branch, and push it back up to the remote repository.

### Files used
Files used for this project are - bikeshare.py, data(.csv)file and .gitignore file
